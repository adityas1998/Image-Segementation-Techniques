# Image-Segementation-Techniques
A repository to collect all the techniques I've learnt and applied in my Computer Graphics course. This includes clustering, thresholding, colour detection, fast fourier transform and the list will be updated as I continue learning. 

# Clustering
I have attempted to apply K-means clustering on a couple of satellite images from google earth in this notebook. The method itself wasn't very effective in giving us the colors one might require for segmentation. This, however, can be further improved with better preprocessing techniques as a part of further work.

# Image_processing
In this notebook I've played with basic thresholding techniques in order to segment the concrete region from the image.

# Image_processing_II
Colour based segmentation has been applied in this notebook to segregate trees from the image(but not just all the green areas), water bodies and there's an attempt to identify road layout.

# Fourier
This notebook focusses on applying fast fourier transform on various images. Then low frequency regions have been removed in order to detect edges. Also, HOG has been applied in this notebook to further observe object/edge detection.
